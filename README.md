# Chess-AI
  A Neural Network eventually capable of playing chess at the intermediate or intermediate high-level



# Why
  Other than my personal curiosity, there is no specific reason for creating this ai.
  I've always enjoyed working with AI, and after doing so over the past several months, I'd want to put my knowledge to the test and enhance my abilities by       releasing this project. Nonetheless, this is mostly for a school assignment, but it is completely unnecessary given that it is only for a math class. However,   I find it amusing and am curious of what the results may be.

# Project Plan
  1. Create Network
  2. Document Network results in a csv
  3. Create a script that reads csv and makes desiered graphs

# Neural Network Plan
  1. Intilize network with random weights
  2. Take a batch of examples, and compute the error of the network w.r.t. these examples
  3. compute the global error by averaging over all individual errors
  4. for all weights 𝑤𝑖 , compute the partial derivative w.r.t. 𝑤𝑖
  5. depending on the partial derivative, increase or decrease slightly each weight 𝑤𝑖

# Goals
  Get a deeper understanding of Back-Propegation by Gradient Descent, minimax algorithm, learning rate, alpha-beta search and bias
  Make the Neural Network play chess(potentially beat humans)
  
  Bonus:
  Make an executable for linux, macOs and Windows with seemless integration
 
Any feedback along the way would be appericated!!
